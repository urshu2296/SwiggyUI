SwiggyUI : 

In this SwiftUI code snippet, I have demonstrated how to present a bottom half sheet using various SwiftUI features:

Opacity and Transparency: By adjusting the opacity of a color, you create a transparent background that partially obscures the underlying content,
creating the effect of a modal presentation.

Frame Sizes: By specifying the frame size of the child view (BottomSheetBlurView), you control its dimensions and appearance on the screen,
ensuring it occupies the desired portion of the screen.

ZStack Alignments: Utilizing a ZStack with alignments helps in layering views and positioning them relative to each other. In this case,
using .bottom alignment ensures that the child view is positioned at the bottom of the screen.

Some more additional observations and considerations for the code :

State Management: The code utilizes @State and @Binding to manage the presentation state (isPresentingModal)
between the parent (ContentView) and child (BottomSheetBlurView) views. This ensures that changes in one view reflect in the other.

View Composition: Views are composed hierarchically using SwiftUI's view composition techniques. This promotes code reusability and modularity,
making it easier to maintain and understand the structure of the UI.

User Interaction: User interaction is handled using onTapGesture. Tapping on the parent view (Color.black) or child view (BottomSheetBlurView) 
triggers actions to toggle the presentation state, showing or dismissing the modal view.

Data Binding: The code uses data binding (@Binding) to pass data (the selected dish) between views. T
his enables communication between the parent and child views without tightly coupling them.
